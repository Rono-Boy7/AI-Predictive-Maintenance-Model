# AI-Predictive-Maintenance-Model

- Designed a machine learning model using Python and frameworks such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to predict equipment failures in industrial machinery.
- Processed large datasets, engineered features, and trained models (Random Forest, SVM) achieving 85% accuracy.
- Reduced unexpected downtime by 20% and visualized results with Matplotlib and Seaborn to assist stakeholder decision-making.
